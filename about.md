Hi, my name is Axel Dahlin. I'm a web developer from Sweden living in Berlin. 

In the end of 2017 I started to playing around with code in my free time, learning from sites like Free Code Camp. In the beginning of 2018 I realized software development was my passion and I decided to make it my career. I shifted my focus towards learning web development and saving money for a coding bootcamp.

In the autumn of 2018 I had enough coding knowledge and money to move to Berlin and enroll in a bootcamp called Ironhack. After the bootcamp I started my career by joining Ironhack as a teacher assistant. 

On this blog I write about web development and and topics related to software development in general. I find that writing about a topic helps me retain the information better. And maybe someone that just started out can be help by the articles as well.

The joy of seeing your program "come to live" is really unrivalled. And the best part is that there is infinite more things to build!

The main technologies I use are:

* Node.js

* Express.js

* MongoDB

* React.js 


When I'm not coding I like to work out, read books on personal development, travel, explore Berlin, cook or hang out with friends.
